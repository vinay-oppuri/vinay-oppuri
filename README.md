## Hey there! 👋

**I'm <u>Vinay</u>**, a computer science engineering student and developer based in India.

I build web applications, experiment with AI, and enjoy turning ideas into working products.

If something sparks my curiosity, I usually try to build it and ship it.

My main tech stack includes **Next.js, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Node.js**, and I'm actively exploring **Machine Learning and Agentic AI**.

I've built multiple public projects, ranging from full-stack web apps to AI-driven systems. Most of my learning comes from building things end-to-end.

If you want to see what I’m working on, check out my pinned repositories or my <u>[portfolio](https://vinay-oppuri.vercel.app/)</u>.

Fun Facts:
- I enjoy clean UI and smooth animations  
- I like building systems more than tutorials  
- Currently focused on leveling up DSA + AI  
- Interests: web, AI agents, performance optimization
